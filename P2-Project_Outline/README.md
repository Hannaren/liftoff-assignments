## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	The FOIA Request Generator assists users in the creation of request letters to be sent to agencies when seeking information under the Freedom of Information Act.
	As a journalist  if can often times be difficult to get agencies to willingly hand over information about themselves.
	However, government and other public agencies are required to release a variety of information when requested under the Freedom of Information Act or a similar state law.
	Doing so usually requires sending a letter either electronically or physically to the agency requesting the information/records you are seeking, often times the letters cite the law which allows the sender to request the information.
	Remembering everything necessary to send a proper letter can be difficult. This is what the generator takes care of for the user.
